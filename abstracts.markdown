Commit early, Deploy often
--------------------------
**John Ferlito** - *Robot Parade*

Deploying an application shouldn't be hard it should be easy. In this presentation John will describe how through the use of a combination of standard Dev and Ops tools, deployment of an application into staging and even production can be made simple enough to empower anyone in you team to do it. While this presentation will focus on deploying rails applications, the techniques described could also be applied to other application deployments.

*John is a serial entrepreneur as well as an expert in highly available and scalable infrastructure, a highly competent systems administrator and software developer.*

*John has founded a variety of businesses including Vquence - Social and Video Metrics, Robot Parade - Open Source Systems Integrator, Beagle Internet - Internet Service Provider and Bulletproof Networks - Managed Services and Hosting. John is currently CTO of Vquence, Executive Director at Robot Parade and Director of Inodes Consulting.*

*In his spare time John is involved in the FOSS communities. He is currently the treasurer of Linux Australia and the Annodex Association. He was a co-organiser of linux.conf.au 2007 a committee member of SLUG in 2007 and has worked on various open source projects including Debian, Ubuntu, Puppet and the Annodex suite.

Build Audit and Processes: A line of sight from DEV to PROD
-----------------------------------------------------------
**Alec Clews** - *Voga Consulting*

Both agile and waterfall approaches to software delivery are a way to translate business needs into production features. Being able to trace that path is often crucial to affective delivery (and sometimes passing critical compliance regulations). Frequently the activity of software building breaks these important traceability links because of poor process and technology.

This presentation briefly examines these problems and looks at various approaches to overcoming them. An emphasis is placed on using processes and version control tool to provide a) Useful information and b) Audit trails of individual builds. A simple, illustrative, example using the Git DVCS is demonstrated.

*Alec has over twenty five years in software: managing development and implementation projects; consulting; design work and programming. Alec is unusual because he can manage wider project issues and understands what business value is, whilst still remaining very technical. Alec has been part of the Open Source Community since 1993 and using the Internet since 1992. His experience spans embedded microprocessor systems to z/OS mainframes and includes significant Windows and Linux/UNIX knowledge.*

What The Fuck Is DevOps?
------------------------
**James Turnbull** - *NAB*

In a period of a month or so about ten or so people all came out and declared what they thought "DevOps" was -- including me.  This was followed by a number of others coming out of the woodwork and stating "No, it's not -- that's insertotherideaorproductorvendorbuzzword here" or "Der, of course it is and by-the-way we've been doing that since monkey's climbed down from the trees".  In this discussion I'm going to explore the differing viewpoints and try to make some sense of the debate or if it even is a debate.

*James is an author and open source geek. James authored the first (and thus far only) book about Puppet. He is also the author of three other books including Pro Linux System Administration, Pro Nagios 2.0, and Hardening Linux. For a real job, James runs the CERT function at the National Australia Bank. He likes food, wine, books, photography and cats. He is not overly keen on long walks on the beach and holding hands.*

Atomic Build Systems: The Nuclear Option
---
** James Dumay ** - *Atlassian*

The phrase "Real Artists Ship" has been attributed to Steve Jobs in Apples early history. What it means is while creating amazing, cool, and innovative features is important to anyone in the software business the most important is to actually deliver working quality software to the customer.

Build and Release is an area that is frequently ignored or considered a getto of the software engineering process but shipping your software is a feature like any other.

In this talk James will cover what Atlassian is has been doing by using isolation, virtual machines, change promotion and staging of production systems to improve the accounting and quality of the software that is shipped, how both developers and systems engineers can use these techniques to work better together and how you can use the ideas and tools in talk to implement better processes in your organisation no matter how large or small you are.

*James Dumay is a software developer at Atlassian in Sydney who specialised in creating Developer Tools and Processes. He started his career working for a local software company in Sydney in 2004 where he developed a taste for improving the productivity of software developers and ended up working for Atlassian as Release Engineer in 2007 improving the way that software is built and shipped to customers.*

*James is now a member on the Bamboo team at Atlassian and is focusing on building a better development and deployment tools using Continuous Integration.*

Flex Your Tests
---
** Tim Moore ** - *Atlassian*

Functional tests are an important tool during development, but it can be difficult to ensure full coverage of your system. It's common to need to use multiple testing frameworks to provide fast-running tests for developers, accurate cross-browser integration testing, performance and load testing, and web service API tests.  Unfortunately, this often results in redundant effort, duplicating the same test scenarios using different tools, or worse, missing critical test cases in some of them. What's more, these tests can fail to find problems that only manifest in production, if they are written in such a way that they can only execute against development environments.

With a well-factored test harness, it's possible to write functional tests once that can execute in a variety of configurations. See how to write a flexible testing framework for a web application with a hands-on demo that demonstrates techniques for creating tests that can be run on developers' workstations, in automated continuous integration builds, and during deployment to production.

*Tim Moore is a developer at Atlassian, where he is the tech lead for JIRA Studio, Atlassian's hosted development suite. He is a long-time advocate of agile development methodologies, automated testing, and cross-functional, integrated teams.*

*Tim is a newcomer to Australia, having just moved to Sydney in February after working in Atlassian's San Francisco office for two years. Prior to working at Atlassian, he held software engineering positions at Salesforce.com, Learning Objects and Blackboard.*

The programme is a work in progress - if you are interested in
giving a talk, please [let us know](/contact)!

Talk topics will cover a range of Devops subjects, spanning process,
methodology, and tools.
