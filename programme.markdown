Call For Participation
======================

The call for participation for DevOps Down Under 2012 [is open](/participate)!

Speakers are the lifeblood of the conference. They set the agenda for what people
are talking about in the corridors during the breaks, and plants the seeds for
the Open Space discussions.

You could be part of the elite few who speak on the main conference programme!

If you have an awesome story to tell about:

 * How you or your organisation has broken the wall between Dev and Ops,
 * A tool you've written to reduce friction when testing/deploying/monitoring,
 * How DevOps applies to non IT-focused industries,
 * Adapting techniques and methodologies from other disciplines in your organisation,
 * Scaling a web infrastructure through awesome tools and team collaboration,
 * Building a business with small cross-functional teams,
 * Or something DevOps related that's new and innovative

...you should [submit a talk](/participate)!

The Call For Participation closes on Monday the 18th of June.

Open Space
----------

Open spaces are free form attendee driven sessions that run on both afternoons of the conference. They're
a venue for attendees to share ideas, demo tools, and trade war stories.

On the day, conference attendees will be invited to write down their session ideas on an index card,
and will have 15 seconds to spruik the idea in front of everyone. Attendees will vote on which sessions
they want to see, and sessions will be assigned to break out rooms.

The best open space sessions have a small amount of preparation done before hand, but spontaneous session
ideas organised on the day always yield surprisingly awesome results.
