      Building on the tremendous success of last year's conference, Australian developers
      and sysadmins are invited to Devops Down Under 2011 - a
      conference about advancing our processes &amp; methodologies, building better tools,
      and improving communication between developers and sysadmins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devops" is a movement of like-minded sysadmins and developers interested in bridging
      the artificial gap between our camps. It's impossible for sysadmins to do their job
      without reading or writing code, and developers need intimate systems knowledge to
      scale their software.

    <p>
      The walls between us are being broken down &mdash; it's time to start learning from each
      other.
