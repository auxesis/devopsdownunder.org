<div id="JasonYip"></div>
Kanban for IT Operations
---------
**Jason Yip** - ThoughtWorks

IT operation is more than than just deployments.  This talk is about using principles and techniques from Kanban to help visualise, measure, and improve IT operations.

Smoothing the flow from development to delivery using Kanban
---------
**David Joyce** - ThoughtWorks

Part one of this talk provides an introduction to Kanban covering the Kanban method, the goals of Kanban, and how Kanban provides for an evolutionary approach to improvement.

Part two of this talk revolves around a series of experience reports following the introduction of Kanban at the BBC in mid 2008.

After Kanban principles were applied in a single product team, Kanban "flu" spread to teams doing legacy application support, fixed delivery projects, product development, SAP development, creative design, and a commercial off the shelf (COTS) implementation.

The "flu" also escaped the borders of development and was embraced by those within Operations resulting in cross functional collaboration between development and operations teams, who working together improved the end to end times to deliver software to BBC customers.

The experience reports will show empirical evidence that teams using Kanban have achieved high levels of maturity and have done so within time frames hitherto unreported. It will also show how Kanban sets an expectation of flow, provides improved predictability and business agility, and enables a kaizen culture (continuous improvement driven from the shop floor) via bottleneck management, waste reduction and variability reduction, thus enabling teams involved in the whole value stream to collaboratively visualise and implement improvements

Sprinkling DevOps Magic In Other People's Environments
---------
**Robert Postill** - C3 business solutions

Description: Many Devops shops work with VMs in clouds or data centres they have ownership of (or at least have put money into).  If there's a problem then the control those Devops shops exert can help them recover, rollback and redeploy.   We don't, we ship virtual appliances with a Ruby on Rails application  to customers.  This presents some particular problems.  For instance performance discussions are much more difficult if you're telling someone their infrastructure is a problem.

This talk is part discussion of our state of the art and part discussion of how we got to where we are.   It should appeal to DevOps leads and architects who are looking to use DevOps techniques to manage systems that aren't in their direct control.  In order to get ourselves in order we use a combination of tools like chef and New Relic to deploy, maintain and monitor our environment. We're not sure if we're doing it right but it sure beats trying to make operations playbooks :)

Feature flipping and Heroku-style deployment at learnable.com
---------
**Leni Mayo** - [learnable.com](http://learnable.com)

At [learnable.com](http://learnable.com), "git push" triggers deployment to the production learnable.com.  This talk explores how a simple setup can support the continuous integration and deployment needs of a small startup.

The talk explores a related concept - feature flipping - a scheme for turning application features on and off at runtime.  The implementation, use, and practical business benefits of feature flipping are discussed.

How Puppet fits into the larger ecosystem
---------
**Garrett Honeycutt** - Puppet Labs

The goal of this presentation is to discuss how Puppet fits in and interacts with the rest of your infrastructure and to share best practices learned. We may begin with an overview of Puppet and how it works and then move on to to cover provisioning, software repository management, disposable architecture, self identifying systems, and change management techniques.

Downtime, stateful systems, and using clouds to stop rain on your parade
---------
**Wade Millican** - Ninefold

When you're down, it's too late. Minds go racing, adrenalin's flowing. It's not an 'if' but 'when'. How have you prepared for this event? Do you even know you're down until you get the call? Could you use Cloud Bursting to sit ahead of an outage, or mitigate client/customer impact? We'll start in the trenches and end up in the clouds. Let's all fly the friendly skies.
