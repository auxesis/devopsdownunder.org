      Developers and sysadmins are invited to DevOps Down Under 2012 - an
      Australian DevOps conference about advancing our processes &amp; methodologies,
      building better tools, and improving communication between developers and sysadmins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year's conference is going bush, being hosted in <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoomba">Katoomba</a> in the New South Wales
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_(New_South_Wales)">Blue Mountains</a>,
      110km west of Sydney.

      "DevOps" is a movement of like-minded sysadmins and developers interested in bridging
      the artificial gap between our camps. It's impossible for sysadmins to do their job
      without reading or writing code, and developers need intimate systems knowledge to
      scale their software.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls between us are being broken down &mdash; it's time to start learning from each
      other.
