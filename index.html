    Building on the tremendous success of <a href="http://devopsdays.org">Devopsdays</a>
    in 2009, Australian developers and sysadmins are invited to Devops Down Under - a
    conference about advancing our processes &amp; methodologies, building better tools,
    and improving communication between developers and sysadmins.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Devops" is a movement of like-minded sysadmins and developers interested in bridging
    the artificial gap between our camps. It's impossible for sysadmins to do their job
    without reading or writing code, and developers need intimate systems knowledge to
    scale their software.
  </p>
  <p>
    The walls between us are being broken down &mdash; it's time to start learning from each
    other.
