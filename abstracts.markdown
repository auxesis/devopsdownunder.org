Commit early, Deploy often
--------------------------
**John Ferlito** - *Robot Parade*

Deploying an application shouldn't be hard it should be easy. In this presentation John will describe how through the use of a combination of standard Dev and Ops tools, deployment of an application into staging and even production can be made simple enough to empower anyone in you team to do it. While this presentation will focus on deploying rails applications, the techniques described could also be applied to other application deployments.

*John is serial entrepreneur currently the CTO of Vquence a Social and Video Metrics business and Founder of Robot Parade an Open Source Systems Integrator. In his spare time John is involved in the FOSS communities. He is currently the treasurer of Linux Australia and the Annodex Association. He was a co-organiser of linux.conf.au 2007 a committee member of SLUG in 2007 and has worked on various open source projects including Debian, Ubuntu, Puppet and the Annodex suite.

Build Audit and Processes: A line of sight from DEV to PROD
-----------------------------------------------------------
**Alec Clews** - *Voga Consulting*

Both agile and waterfall approaches to software delivery are a way to translate business needs into production features. Being able to trace that path is often crucial to affective delivery (and sometimes passing critical compliance regulations). Frequently the activity of software building breaks these important traceability links because of poor process and technology.

This presentation briefly examines these problems and looks at various approaches to overcoming them. An emphasis is placed on using processes and version control tool to provide a) Useful information and b) Audit trails of individual builds. A simple, illustrative, example using the Git DVCS is demonstrated.

*Alec has over twenty five years in software: managing development and implementation projects; consulting; design work and programming. Alec is unusual because he can manage wider project issues and understands what business value is, whilst still remaining very technical. Alec has been part of the Open Source Community since 1993 and using the Internet since 1992. His experience spans embedded microprocessor systems to z/OS mainframes and includes significant Windows and Linux/UNIX knowledge.*

What The Fuck Is DevOps?
------------------------
**James Turnbull** - *NAB*

In a period of a month or so about ten or so people all came out and declared what they thought "DevOps" was -- including me.  This was followed by a number of others coming out of the woodwork and stating "No, it's not -- that's insertotherideaorproductorvendorbuzzword here" or "Der, of course it is and by-the-way we've been doing that since monkey's climbed down from the trees".  In this discussion I'm going to explore the differing viewpoints and try to make some sense of the debate or if it even is a debate.

*James is an author and open source geek. James authored the first (and thus far only) book about Puppet. He is also the author of three other books including Pro Linux System Administration, Pro Nagios 2.0, and Hardening Linux. For a real job, James runs the CERT function at the National Australia Bank. He likes food, wine, books, photography and cats. He is not overly keen on long walks on the beach and holding hands.*
