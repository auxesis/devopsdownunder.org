Call For Participation
======================

The call for participation for DevOps Down Under 2012 is open!

Speakers are the lifeblood of the conference. They set the agenda for what people
are talking about during the corridors during the breaks, and plants the seeds for
discussion during the Open Spaces.

You could be part of the elite few who speak on the main conference programme!

If you have an awesome story to tell about:

 * How you or your organisation has broken the wall between Dev and Ops,
 * A tool you've written to reduce friction when testing/deploying/monitoring,
 * How DevOps applies to non IT-focused industries,
 * Adapting techniques and methodologies from other disciplines in your organisation,
 * Scaling a web infrastructure through awesome tools and team collaboration,
 * Building a business with small cross-functional teams,
 * Or something DevOps related that's new and innovative

...you should [submit a talk](#submit)!

The Call For Participation closes on Monday the 18th of June.
