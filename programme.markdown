Commit early, Deploy often
--------------------------
**John Ferlito** - Robot Parade

Deploying an application shouldn't be hard it should be easy. In this presentation John will describe how through the use of a combination of standard Dev and Ops tools, deployment of an application into staging and even production can be made simple enough to empower anyone in you team to do it. While this presentation will focus on deploying rails applications, the techniques described could also be applied to other application deployments.

Build Audit and Processes: A line of sight from DEV to PROD
-----------------------------------------------------------
**Alec Clews** - Voga Consulting

Both agile and waterfall approaches to software delivery are a way to translate business needs into production features. Being able to trace that path is often crucial to affective delivery (and sometimes passing critical compliance regulations). Frequently the activity of software building breaks these important traceability links because of poor process and technology.

This presentation briefly examines these problems and looks at various approaches to overcoming them. An emphasis is placed on using processes and version control tool to provide a) Useful information and b) Audit trails of individual builds. A simple, illustrative, example using the Git DVCS is demonstrated.

<div class="bio">

Alec has over twenty five years in software: managing development and implementation projects; consulting; design work and programming. Alec is unusual because he can manage wider project issues and understands what business value is, whilst still remaining very technical.

What The Fuck Is DevOps?
------------------------
**James Turnbull** - Puppet Labs

In a period of a month or so about ten or so people all came out and declared what they thought "DevOps" was -- including me.  This was followed by a number of others coming out of the woodwork and stating "No, it's not -- that's insertotherideaorproductorvendorbuzzword here" or "Der, of course it is and by-the-way we've been doing that since monkey's climbed down from the trees".  In this discussion I'm going to explore the differing viewpoints and try to make some sense of the debate or if it even is a debate.

<div class="bio">

James is an author and open source geek. James authored the first (and thus far only) book about Puppet. He is also the author of three other books including Pro Linux System Administration, Pro Nagios 2.0, and Hardening Linux.

Atomic Build Systems: The Nuclear Option
----------------------------------------
** James Dumay ** - Atlassian

The phrase "Real Artists Ship" has been attributed to Steve Jobs in Apples early history. What it means is while creating amazing, cool, and "innovative" features is important to anyone in the software business, the most important is to actually deliver working quality software to the customer.

Build and Release is an area that is frequently ignored or considered a getto of the software engineering process but shipping your software is a feature like any other.

In this talk James will cover what Atlassian is has been doing by using isolation, virtual machines, change promotion and staging of production systems to improve the accounting and quality of the software that is shipped, how both developers and systems engineers can use these techniques to work better together and how you can use the ideas and tools in talk to implement better processes in your organisation no matter how large or small you are.

<div class="bio">
<p>
James Dumay is a software developer at Atlassian in Sydney who specialised in creating Developer Tools and Processes. He started his career working for a local software company in Sydney in 2004 where he developed a taste for improving the productivity of software developers and ended up working for Atlassian as Release Engineer in 2007, improving the way that software is built and shipped to customers.
</p>
<p>
James is now a member on the Bamboo team at Atlassian and is focusing on building a better development and deployment tools using Continuous Integration.

Smart Grid Operational Information Distribution
-----------------------------------------------
** Joel Courtney ** - *EnergyAustralia*

Monitoring of the electricity network that underpins modern society is undergoing a technology step change. Advances in telecommunications technologies has allowed the deployment of devices to provide continuous monitoring of wide areas via 3G and 4G technologies. With this comes a challenge - how to distribute the data reported, with enough additional information to give it context, to staff located across its 20,000km<sup>2</sup> coverage area.

ION is EnergyAustralia's solution - a web application interfacing to current and historical measurements, network topology and geographic information and asset details to provide an integrated overview of assets operating in the
network.

EnergyAustralia is a leading distribution network, at the forefront of Smart Grid developments, both locally in Australia and internationally. Its Smart Grid programme covers five major components: transmission, distribution, customer, telecommunications and IT systems.

<div class="bio">
<p>
As the resident geek of EnergyAustralia's Smart Grid group, Joel Courtney currently heads up visualisation deliverables associated with the Smart Grid Programme in addition to investigating technologies for the network of tomorrow.

With a background as a "sunshine hippy" engineer (BE Photovoltaics & Solar Energy, UNSW), and has relished the opportunity to challenge the status quo in the field of Power Engineering, of which he also has a Masters of Engineering Science in.
</p>
<p>
Joel has been dabbling in the world of web for over half his life, and wants to see the developments seen online in usability, standards and accessibility become an integral part of enterprise application development.

Flex Your Tests
---------------
** Tim Moore ** - Atlassian

Functional tests are an important tool during development, but it can be difficult to ensure full coverage of your system. It's common to need to use multiple testing frameworks to provide fast-running tests for developers, accurate cross-browser integration testing, performance and load testing, and web service API tests.  Unfortunately, this often results in redundant effort, duplicating the same test scenarios using different tools, or worse, missing critical test cases in some of them. What's more, these tests can fail to find problems that only manifest in production, if they are written in such a way that they can only execute against development environments.

With a well-factored test harness, it's possible to write functional tests once that can execute in a variety of configurations. See how to write a flexible testing framework for a web application with a hands-on demo that demonstrates techniques for creating tests that can be run on developers' workstations, in automated continuous integration builds, and during deployment to production.
